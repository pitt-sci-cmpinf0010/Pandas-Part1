# Readme

If you have questions about this week's lab ANY TA for this class can help you with any problems.

## pandas :panda_face:

This week, we are returning to Python. Specifically, our focus will be on an add-on for Python called pandas. This might get confusing, so here's a link to a cheatsheet to refer back to whenever you're confused. Trust me, it'll be useful.
* [Pandas Cheat Sheet](https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)

## Getting Started Againâ„¢

1. Log into SCI JupyterHub and start a terminal
2. Type in `git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/Pandas-Part1.git` and hit the enter key
3. This should download a folder to your JupyterHub with the lab (it should be called `Pandas-Part1`)
4. Double click the new folder in the file explorer. You should see the lab contents.
5. Launch the `Lab-Exercises.ipynb` notebook. You can also launch `Lab-Lesson.ipynb` if you need a refresher on what the UTA went over in the skills lab.

### If JupyterHub doesn't work for you

Use Binder!

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to you computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

## Completing the Lab

You can modify `Lab-Exercises.ipynb`. Add your own cells, but don't delete the original problems - this helps us match up your answers to each exercise and check that you did all of the work.

## Submitting your lab

We will use [Canvas](canvas.pitt.edu) to let you upload your labs. 

1. First, if you used the SCI JupyterHub, Virtual Lab, or Binder, you're going to have to download the notebook to your computer.
    * On JupyterHub, right click on your exercise notebook on your file browser on the left
    * Click **Download** and save it somewhere

2. Then, go to Canvas to upload your lab.
    * In Canvas, click on our class
    * Go to Assignments
    * Click on the Skills Lab assignment for this week
    * Click **Submit Assignment** in the top right
    * Choose your Notebook file you saved/created/downloaded earlier (will end in `.ipynb`)
    * Hit Submit!

If you are confused, here is a [tutorial](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-upload-a-file-as-an-assignment-submission-in-Canvas/ta-p/274) on how to submit an assignment on Canvas.

**Note:** you can re-upload your lab as many times as you want before the deadline.
