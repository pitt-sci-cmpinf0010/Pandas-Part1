## Office hours

If you have questions about this week's lab, reading, or lecture, ANY TA for this class can help you with any problems. That being said, only email YOUR TA. Office hours will be held in the same place as usual. If none of these times work for you, please don't hesitate to reach out via email to set up another time.

## pandas :panda_face:

This week, we are returning to Python. Specifically, our focus will be on an add-on for Python called pandas. This might get confusing, so here's a link to a cheatsheet to refer back to whenever you're confused. Trust me, it'll be useful.
* [Pandas Cheat Sheet](https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)

## Getting Startedâ„¢

1. Open Jupyter Lab and start a terminal
2. Navigate to the folder you wish to download this lab to
3. Type in `git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/lab-7.git` and hit the enter key
4. This should download a folder to your local machine with the lab (it should be called lab-7)
5. Launch the desired notebook

### If JupyterLab _really_ doesn't work for you

Use Binder:

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to your computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.

Click this button to get started with Binder:

## Submitting your finished lab

We will use [Canvas](canvas.pitt.edu) to let you upload your labs. 

1. First, you're going to have to download the notebook to your computer.
    * On JupyterHub, right click on your exercise notebook on your file browser on the left
    * Click **Download** and save it somewhere

2. Then, go to Canvas to upload your lab.
    * In Canvas, click on our class, then Modules
    * Click on the Skills Lab module for this week
    * Click **Submit Assignment** in the top right
    * Choose your Notebook file you downloaded earlier (will end in `.ipynb`)
    * Hit Submit!


Note: you can re-upload your lab as many times as you want before the deadline.
