        "# So, what is pandas anyway?\n",
        "\n",
        "`pandas` is a third-party Python library for doing data analysis. It's developed and maintained by [Wes McKinney](http://wesmckinney.com/pages/about.html), who at the time of initial development was working in finance. Suffice to say, **pandas is very much beta software**, like JupyterLab. There are going to be some bugs, design flaws, and other issues that you're going to run into; I'll address them as they come up in class, and if you run into them on your own, we can work through them together in office hours.\n",
        "\n",
        "pandas is a foundational part of using Python for data science. Most if not all things that pandas does can be done with plain-jane Python, but, most of the time, pandas does them *faster* and *easier*. It's built on top of another extremely powerful third-party Python library called `numpy`; if you are doing data analysis on a huge scale, consider `numpy`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why are *we* using pandas?\n",
        "\n",
        "We're using pandas because it has a powerful set of *structures* and *functions* that make working with large datasets simple. Once you learn these structures and functions, it becomes extremely easy to answer any question you want to ask with a given data set. This is my definition of **data analysis**: answering questions asked of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "pandas also interacts nicely with a bunch of other Python libraries and programs, which make doing data science easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Jupyter notebooks, of course, allow you to construct computational narratives with code, data, and text. Displaying dataframes (one of pandas' data structures) as an inline HTML table is one of the major interactions between Jupyter and pandas.\n",
        "* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is an incredibly powerful graphing library for Python. Generating plots from dataframes is simple with matplotlib and pandas.\n",
        "* pandas also integrates with scientific computing/machine learning Python libraries, like [SciKit](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)."
